## CSV Filename Format

Reports are named:
`gfsr-report-{ID}-{FORMNAME}-{SCHEDULETYPE}-{yyyymmdd}.csv`

Example:  
`gfsr-report-12-CONTACT-FORM-daily-20240607.csv`

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Fields not updating:** If you add or remove fields in your Gravity Form, resave the form in Gravity Forms to refresh the field list in the schedule editor.
- **Cron jobs not running:** WordPress cron depends on site traffic. Use a real cron job for reliable scheduling, or trigger WP-Cron externally.
- **Caching issues:** If field lists seem stale, clear your browser cache and any WordPress caching plugins (e.g., WP Rocket).
- **Email not sending:** Check your WordPress email configuration. The plugin uses `wp_mail()`.
